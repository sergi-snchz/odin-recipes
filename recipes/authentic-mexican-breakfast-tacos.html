    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Quick Easy and Delicious! I learned this recipe from many years of eating
      with the Mexican cooks at my restaurant. They like to sneak in breakfast
      before we open. I've grown to LOVE this breakfast. If you like spicy food,
      you will love this.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 ounces chorizo sausage</li>
      <li>8 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
      <li>6 eggs</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup milk</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢), or to taste</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crumble the sausage into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir
        until evenly brown. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat one skillet over medium heat, and heat another skillet over high
        heat. The skillet over high heat is for warming tortillas. In a medium
        bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Spray the medium
        heat skillet with some cooking spray, and pour in the eggs. Cook and
        stir until almost firm. Add the sausage, and continue cooking and
        stirring until firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, warm tortillas for about 45 seconds per side in the other
        skillet, so they are hot and crispy on the edges, but still pliable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle a little shredded cheese onto each tortilla while it is still
        hot. Top with some of the scrambled egg and sausage, then add hot pepper
        sauce and salsa to your liking.
      </li>
    </ol>
